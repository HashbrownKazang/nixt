# Nixt

A lot was borrowed from the nuxt3 starter. Thanks to the nuxt3 dev team most of the heavy lifting has been done already. If you also want to get a futuristic web-app then you should look at the [Nuxt 3 documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction) to learn more.

## Setup

I personally started with a blank canvas and borrowed some ideas from the headless-ui repo, but I did want to use nuxt for certain experiments so what I did after I did not get my way by hand was:

NPX nuxi@latest init my-app
So I would recommend if you want something similar you should:
Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
# npm
npm install

# pnpm
pnpm install

# yarn
yarn install
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
# npm
npm run dev

# pnpm
pnpm run dev

# yarn
yarn dev
```

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
# npm
npm run build

# pnpm
pnpm run build

# yarn
yarn build
```

Locally preview production build:

```bash
# npm
npm run preview

# pnpm
pnpm run preview

# yarn
yarn preview
```
